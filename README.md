# Mondrian Project

This is the Mondrian Painting project in the [Udemy course The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING).

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to create a Mondrian style composition using CSS Grid.

## Features

- Painting is centered in the browser using flexbox.
- The painting has five colors displayed in various sizes with a border applied on one shape.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## My Process

- Start the file from a boiler template.
- Create the divs for the shapes required and the grid-container in HTML.
- Add styles for the grid container and applicable colors for each div.
- Modify each div utilizing grid tracks to the correct size with the keyword `span`.
- Add styles to center the painting in the browser.

### Continued development

This was my first project applying the CSS Grid skills I've learned in the course. I found CSS Grid to be much easier to understand than Flexbox and I plan on applying this knowledge to create another Mondrian composition of greater difficulty. I am wondering if this approach could be used to create a photo collage template for cards and may try to apply these skills to achieve that outcome.
